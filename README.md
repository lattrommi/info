# info
various info files used for troubleshooting, primarily via internet forums. <br>

if you see information that probably shouldn't be public, i'd appreciate being told. <br>
if messaging here works, cool! do that!  <br>
lattrommi at y! G∞gle or protonmail work too, much better in fact.  <br>
i check them almost daily, with occasional lapses lasting 2-4 days. <br>

i frequently don't know what i'm doing. please be kind. or don't, i'm not your boss. <br>
i'm poor and unemployed, so if you're a "hacker" in the mass media definition of the word:  <br>
  * i have nothing worth stealing. <br>
  * i break my computer easily - miners and bots are short lived  <br>
  * i'm awkward - social engineering will only provide depression and your phishing nets will be empty <br>
  * if you think i have intellectual property to harvest - lol <br>

if you happen find my dignity, keep it. you deserve it! <br>

final thoughts: is it pronounced "giT-hub" or "gəth-oohb"?
