various info files used for troubleshooting

if you see some that probably shouldn't be public, i'd appreciate being told.
if messaging here works, cool 
y! G or proton work better

i frequently don't know what i'm doing. 
i'm poor and unemployed - nothing worth stealing.
i break my computer easily - miners and bots are short lived (like my os)
i'm awkward - social engineering will only provide depression
i have no family - your phishing nets will be empty
if you find my dignity, keep it. you deserve it

if you think i have intellectual property to harvest - GOTO 8
